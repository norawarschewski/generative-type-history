# The History of Generative Type Design 

The timeline briefly sums up the research I conducted for my master thesis on generative approaches in type design. It includes some key figures, tools, and typefaces.

The structure and code of the timeline is based on a research-project by [Jens Schnitzler](https://github.com/jensschnitzler) ðŸ’ž
